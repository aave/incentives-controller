# Aave incentives

## Introduction

This repo contains the code and implementation of the contracts used to activate the liquidity mining program on the main market of the Aave protocol.

## Deploy on Aurora
npx hardhat --network aurora deploy-incentives-impl

## Implementation

The rewards are distributed in the form of stkAAVE, which is obtained by staking Aave in the Safety Module Staking contract located at https://etherscan.io/address/0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5.

The incentives controller contract, `StakedTokenIncentivesController`, stakes the rewards while transferring the obtained stkAAVE to the claiming user.

The implementation logic is defined as follow:

- Each asset has a defined `emissionPerSecond`
- For each asset, an `assetIndex` keeps track of the total accumulated rewards
- For each user, a `userIndex` keeps track of the user accumulated rewards
- On `handleAction()`, that is triggered whenever an aToken/debt Token is minted/burned by a user, the `userIndex` and the `assetIndex` are accumulated depending on the time passed since the last action
- At any point in time the user pending rewards can be queried through the `getRewardsBalance()` function
